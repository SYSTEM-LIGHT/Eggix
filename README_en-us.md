## üöÄ Project Introduction

Eggix is a collective name for a series of desktop customization components in the style of **"Eggy Party"**, primarily developed by **SYSTEM-LIGHT**. It originates from the now-stalled EggyUI project but has undergone a comprehensive refactoring and quality upgrade.

**Project Positioning**: A high-quality, modular, and irregularly updated personal open-source customization project.

## üìú Project Origin

Eggix was not created out of thin air; its name and concept carry a piece of community "unofficial history":

> According to the (now edited) entry for "Little Blue Egg" on the *Eggy Party* Wiki:
> "The founder of Eggysoft, developed the **Eggix operating system** at Baker Labs, featuring the EggyUI desktop environment, and was called 'the Bill Gates of Eggy Island'; he open-sourced all the developed algorithms and OS kernel on **EggitHub**..."

This project's name pays homage to this imaginative piece of community lore. If EggyUI was the unrealized desktop environment, then **Eggix aims to be the tangible component set that builds that fantasy world**.

## ‚ú® Relationship with EggyUI

*   **Spiritual Successor**: Eggix inherits the aesthetic philosophy of EggyUI, aiming to bring an authentic "Eggy Party" style experience to the Windows desktop.
*   **Qualitative Leap**: All components have been redesigned and redeveloped, offering significant improvements over EggyUI in code quality, runtime efficiency, visual detail, and system compatibility.
*   **Individually Maintained**: Unlike the organizationally chaotic later stages of EggyUI, Eggix is independently maintained by developer **SYSTEM-LIGHT**, ensuring pure technical direction and efficient decision-making.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development and Update Model

*   **Irregular Updates**: This project is driven by the developer's personal interest and available time, **with no fixed release schedule**. Updates might be frequent or have longer intervals.
*   **Modular Approach**: Components will be released as independent modules, allowing users to choose what they need and avoid unnecessary system load.
*   **Open Source and Transparency**: All code will be open-sourced on GitHub/Gitee, adhering to the non-commercial usage licenses.

## üîí Copyright and Disclaimer

*   **Fan Creation**: This project is a fan-made, non-profit, unofficial creation inspired by the style of *Eggy Party*.
*   **Original and Compliant**: All visual elements are either redrawn or sourced from legal channels; no assets extracted from the game are used.

    *   The Eggix project is not affiliated with or sponsored by NetEase or Microsoft.

## üéØ Summary

The story of EggyUI may have paused, but the exploration of its spirit continues under the name **Eggix**.

This is a new beginning‚Äîmore focused, higher quality, and yet more casual.
