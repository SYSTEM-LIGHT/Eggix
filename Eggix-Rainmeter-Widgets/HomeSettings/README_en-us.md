# Eggix-Rainmeter-Widgets/HomeSettings

## Project Positioning

**HomeSettings** is one of the core components of the **Eggix** project, focusing on providing a user-friendly personalization interface for "Eggy Party" style Rainmeter desktop widgets. As the configuration center of the Eggix-Rainmeter-Widgets module, it handles the customization of user avatars and nicknames, ensuring these personalized settings are correctly applied to the desktop display components.

## Feature Overview

The HomeSettings component provides the following core features:

1. **Avatar Customization**:
   - Offers 12 preset avatars for users to choose from
   - Supports importing custom avatars from local storage (with circular cropping via CircleCropTool)
   - Automatically creates backups when changing avatars to ensure operation safety

2. **Nickname Modification**:
   - Allows users to customize the nickname displayed on desktop components
   - Directly modifies Rainmeter configuration files to achieve instant updates
   - Includes comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

3. **Intelligent Resolution Adaptation**:
   - Automatically detects the user's monitor resolution
   - Loads corresponding high-quality background images based on screen height (4K/2K/1080P and below)
   - Provides multiple fail-safes to ensure proper background display in any environment

4. **High DPI Support**:
   - Automatically sets high DPI awareness mode when the program starts
   - Optimizes display effects of visual elements at different DPI scaling ratios
