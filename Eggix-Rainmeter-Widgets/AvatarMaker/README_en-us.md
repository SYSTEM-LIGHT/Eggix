# OpenEggyUI - AvatarMaker

## 🎨 Component Introduction

AvatarMaker is one of the auxiliary components of OpenEggyUI. Its core function is to crop the avatar image provided by the user into an avatar image with a circular border, providing uniformly styled avatar materials for other components of OpenEggyUI (such as desktop widgets).

This tool is developed based on PySide6, and interactive windows can be quickly built through visual UI design files to conveniently implement avatar customization functions.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Development Language**: Python 3.12.7
- **GUI Framework**: PySide6

## 📦 Build and Installation

### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.12.7 (**Required**)

### Dependency Installation

Execute the following command in the component directory to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generating UI Code and Resource Files

The UI interface of this project is designed using Qt Designer and saved as `form.ui`. It needs to be converted into a Python-callable code file. At the same time, the resource file `resources.qrc` needs to be compiled into a Python module. Please execute the following commands in the component directory:

Generate UI code:
```bash
pyside6-uic form.ui -o ui_form.py
```

Compile resource file:
```bash
pyside6-rcc resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py
```

### Running Method

```bash
python main.py
```

### Packaging and Building

Supports building with PyInstaller and Nuitka (the Nuitka build script is not yet completed).

- Relevant build scripts are included in the **Build directory** and can be used directly.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. Launch the program
2. Click "Import Image" to select a local avatar
3. The program automatically crops it into a circular border
4. After previewing the effect, click "Export Avatar" to save
5. Use the exported avatar for other components of OpenEggyUI

## ⚠️ Notes

- Only common image formats (such as JPG, PNG, etc.) are supported
- For the best results, it is recommended to use square images as input
- The exported avatar image will retain the original image quality
- If the `form.ui` design file is modified, it is necessary to re-execute the `pyside6-uic` command to update the generated Python code to ensure the interface is synchronized with the code
